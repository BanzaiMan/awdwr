Running this should only require Rails 2.2.2 or later, the command line
interfaces for sqlite3 and curl and the will_paginate plugin.
Tested on Ubuntu Linux 9.10 ("Karmic Koala") and Mac OSX 10.5.6 ("Leopard").

Installation of all necessary dependencies from a fresh install of Ubuntu 9.10:

  sudo apt-get install rails git-core sqlite3 curl erubis
  sudo gem install gorp will_paginate rdoc test-unit htmlentities

Execution instructions:

  ruby makedepot.rb [VERSION] [restore] [RANGE]... [save] --work=dir --port=n

    "restore" - restore from snapshot before resuming execution

    "VERSION" specifies the Rails version to test.  Examples:
      edge
      _2.2.2_
      ~/git

    "RANGE" specifies a set of sections to execute.  Examples:
      6.2..6.5
      7.1-9.5
      16

    "save" - save snapshot after execution completes

    --work=dir: name of work directory to use (default: "work")

    --port=n: port number to use for the test (default: 3000)

  Output will be produced as makedepot.html.

Tests against makedepot.html can also be run separately:

  ruby checkdepot.rb

  Output will be produced as checkdepot.html.

Automation tools (still fairly rough):

  dashboard.rb: cgi to monitor status / start jobs
  runtests.rb:  script to set up rvms and to log output
