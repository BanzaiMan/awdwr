Running this should only require Rails 2.2.2 or later, and the command line
interfaces for sqlite3 and curl.  Tested on Ubuntu Linux 9.04 ("Jaunty
Jackalope") and Mac OSX 10.5.6 ("Leopard").

Installation of all necessary dependencies from a fresh install of Ubuntu 9.04:

  sudo apt-get install rails git-core sqlite3 curl
  sudo gem install rubygems-update
  sudo /var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/update_rubygems
  sudo gem install rails

Execution instructions:

  ruby makedepot.rb [VERSION] [RANGE]...
  ruby checkdepot.rb [partial]

  VERSION specifies the Rails version to test.  Examples:
    edge
    _2.2.2_
    ~/git

  RANGE specifies a set of sections to execute.  Examples:
    16
    6.2..6.5

  "partial" means that tests which cover sections that are not included in
    makedepot.html are to be omitted.

Output will be produced as makedepot.html.
